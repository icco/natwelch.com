    <p>I am writing this from New York, and struggling a little for what to say. This isn't a new feeling though. Every year around this time, I try to reflect on our relationship and write something down. Something to express how much of a positive impact you have had on my life. Something to say which I do not often say in person or over the phone.</p>

    <p>Dad, I tell stories of you often. I find your life fascinating and inspiring. I know my life has (and will continue to) follow a different path than yours, but I find your stories, of small and large things, and seeing how you react to things now, constantly helps me find my way in the world.</p>

    <p>So thanks for everything. I love you a lot.</p>
