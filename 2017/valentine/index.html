    <p>My Love,</p>

    <p>Happy Valentine's Day! As of today, it has been two hundred and fifty-four days since we began dating. I have enjoyed every minute of it.</p>

    <p>I have been thinking for days of how to explain my love for you. How to express to you how much you mean to me. How your honesty, your jokes, your meows, your cleverness, your beauty and your nuzzles bring me a strange amount of joy, often in the strangest times.</p>

    <p>I find, that telling you &quot;I love you,&quot; does not express this as well as I had hoped. You see, I adore you. You bring me solace in times of sorrow. Look up love in the thesaurus, all of those words and their many meanings. All of them, in summation, just begins to outline how I feel about you.</p>

    <p>So, as I stumble for words, I must steal a line from my ninja kitty. I feel justified in this act though, as I steal from the same person who somehow snuck into my heart and captured it.</p>

    <p>Thanks for hanging out with me Melissa. I love you.</p>
