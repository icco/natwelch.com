I write once or twice a month at [writing.natwelch.com](https://writing.natwelch.com/).

I have also written for other places:

- [Reliable Webservers with Go](https://www.newline.co/courses/reliable-webservers-with-go/) from Newline.
- [Real-World SRE](https://realworldsre.com/) from Packt Publishing.
- Git Out The Vote: [\#chatops](https://medium.com/git-out-the-vote/chatops-198f0b62c601)
- Code Words: [Promoting reliability in web software companies](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/six/promoting-reliability-in-web-software-companies) & [DDoS and You](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/three/ddos-and-you).

I love writing and talking about writing. If you have a topic you would like me to write about, or would like to discuss writing, shoot [me an email](mailto:nat@natwelch.com).
