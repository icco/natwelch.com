[Aniplaxt](https://github.com/icco/aniplaxt) is an in-progress project to make scrobbling of what you watch on Plex to Anilist work automatically. If you're managing an anime library in Plex and tracking your progress on AniList, this bridges the gap between the two. The service listens for Plex webhooks—notifications fired whenever you watch something—and translates those events into AniList updates. No more manually marking episodes as watched; Plex tells aniplaxt, aniplaxt tells AniList, and you get on with your life.

There's a hosted instance running at aniplaxt.natwelch.com. The project was forked from another scrobbling service and adapted specifically for AniList integration. It's still marked as "under construction," so expect rough edges and missing features, but the core functionality of webhook-to-AniList logging is there. If you're deep enough into anime tracking to care about automation, this scratches that particular itch.
