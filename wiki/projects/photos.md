[Photos](https://photos.natwelch.com/) is a straightforward photo uploading application for hosting and sharing my photographs. Instead of relying on third-party services like Flickr or Google Photos, this provides a lightweight, self-hosted alternative where I control the infrastructure and data. The web interface makes uploading and managing photos simple, and the whole thing is designed to be exactly what it needs to be—a place to put photos and share them with people.

The project is open source at [github.com/icco/photos](https://github.com/icco/photos), so if you also want to escape photo hosting lock-in, the code's available.
