title: Fog

I am a core contributor to [Fog](http://fog.io/), a ruby library for talking to various cloud libraries in a consistent manor.

My contributions have waned in the past years, but I wrote the original implementations for a few of the fog providers, including [fog-google](https://github.com/fog/fog-google).
