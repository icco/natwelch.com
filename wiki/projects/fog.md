title: Fog
---

I am a former core contributor to [Fog](http://fog.io/), a Ruby library for talking to various cloud providers in a consistent way. Fog abstracts away the differences between AWS, Google Cloud, Rackspace, and others, giving you a unified interface for provisioning servers, managing storage, and working with cloud resources. The library works at multiple levels—high-level collections for common tasks, low-level requests for provider-specific features, and mocks for testing without actually spinning up expensive infrastructure. It's designed to reduce vendor lock-in and make switching between cloud providers less painful.

My contributions have waned in recent years, but I wrote the original implementations for a few fog providers, including [fog-google](https://github.com/fog/fog-google).
