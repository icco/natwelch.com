title: cacophony

[Cacophony](https://github.com/icco/cacophony) was a Twitter scraper for my home timeline that converts shared URLs into an RSS feed. Instead of scrolling through Twitter to find interesting links, cacophony extracts all URLs from my timeline and serves them as a standard RSS feed. 

Of course, this was written back when Twitter's API was more cooperative and less expensive to access. Given Twitter's evolution into X and the API changes that came with it, cacophony is defunct. I've debated rewriting it for mastodon, but have yet to do that.
