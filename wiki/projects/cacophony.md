[Cacophony](https://github.com/icco/cacophony) is a Twitter scraper for my home timeline that converts shared URLs into an RSS feed. Instead of scrolling through Twitter to find interesting links, cacophony extracts all URLs from my timeline and serves them as a standard RSS feed. You point your feed reader at it, and all those random articles and blog posts your friends share become a structured stream you can process on your own terms.

Of course, this was written back when Twitter's API was more cooperative and less expensive to access. Given Twitter's evolution into X and the API changes that came with it, cacophony is likely defunct or would require significant updates to work with current API restrictions. It represents a moment when pulling data out of Twitter was still a reasonable side project goal.
