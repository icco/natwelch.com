Life is a project I built starting in 2010 to provide short summaries of what happened in my life every year. It's designed as an interactive timeline—think of it as a personal changelog borrowing the version history concept from software development. Instead of a traditional biography or about page, you can literally scroll through my life story as a series of milestones and events presented chronologically. The idea evolved from originally wanting to visualize life events as JSON data into something more narrative and human-readable. You can explore it at [life.natwelch.com](https://life.natwelch.com).

The project code lives at [github.com/icco/lifeline](https://github.com/icco/lifeline). It's my attempt at creating a unique "about me" experience—structured like software documentation but telling a human story. The changelog format makes it easy to add new entries as life happens, and visitors can navigate through years the same way they'd browse a project's release history.
