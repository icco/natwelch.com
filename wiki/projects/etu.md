Etu is a CLI for keeping an interstitial journal—brief notes about what you just did and what's coming next. Named after the Lakota deity of time, the idea is to replace traditional to-do lists with continuous reflective writing throughout your day. You jot down quick entries documenting your work patterns and maintaining focus.

The entries get stored in Notion so they're accessible across devices. There's a `timesince` command that tells you when you last journaled, which is a gentle nudge to keep the habit going. The whole system is designed around making reflective writing feel natural rather than like another task to avoid.
