title: Tab Archive

[Tab Archive](https://tab-archive.app/) is a browser extension for closing and archiving your tabs. Instead of keeping dozens of tabs open and cluttering your browser, you archive them to a server where you can search and retrieve them later. It's the kind of tool you don't realize you need until your browser starts crawling under the weight of 80+ open tabs.

The extension broke with the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox, so it's currently defunct. The code lives at [github.com/icco/tab-archive](https://github.com/icco/tab-archive). At some point I'd like to return and fix it, since the core problem (too many tabs, not enough organization) hasn't gone anywhere. For now it's a reminder that browser APIs evolve faster than side projects can keep up.
