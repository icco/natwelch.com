[Postmortems](https://postmortems.app/) is a public repository of postmortems with annotated metadata and summaries of incident documents from various organizations. The project systematically catalogs and organizes postmortems, making them searchable and analyzable for the SRE and DevOps communities to learn from past incidents at scale. Instead of postmortems being scattered across company blogs and documentation sites, this aggregates them into one place with structured metadata including categories, timestamps, and deeper analysis capabilities. The community contribution model means the collection keeps growing as people submit new postmortems.

The project includes both a browsing website and a command-line tool. The CLI supports extracting data, generating exports, validating entries, and creating new postmortem entries. The code lives at [github.com/icco/postmortems](https://github.com/icco/postmortems), and the project builds on prior work in the space by expanding both the collection size and analytical depth.
