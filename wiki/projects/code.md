[code](https://github.com/icco/code.natwelch.com) is my scraper and dashboard for tracking Git contributions over time. Instead of relying on GitHub's native contribution graph, this builds a custom analytics interface that aggregates my software development activity across projects. A separate scraper collects contribution data, then the dashboard serves it up with visualizations. It's a way to see coding patterns and productivity trends beyond what GitHub surfaces by default.

The project lives at [code.natwelch.com](https://code.natwelch.com) and provides a personalized view of my open-source work and development history. It is currently down due to a bunch of API changes by github and Google.
