[Writing](https://writing.natwelch.com/) is the static frontend for my blog. It compiles Markdown and MDX files into a web application without needing a dynamic backend. It includes utilities for managing posts—creating, listing, drafting, and updating entries—while keeping things simple and fast.

This is the current iteration after multiple versions of the blog platform. The code lives at [github.com/icco/writing](https://github.com/icco/writing). It's designed to be exactly what a blog needs—fast, simple to maintain, and easy to write for—without the overhead of managing a CMS or database.
