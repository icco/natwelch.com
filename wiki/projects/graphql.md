title: GraphQL
---

GraphQL is my server for storing and serving data across my personal projects. It's a GraphQL-based backend that powers my blog and handles various content types—posts, comments, photos, books, and wiki entries—through a unified API. This is the latest iteration of my personal CMS, succeeding earlier versions like tumble.io and pseudoweb.net. The modular architecture supports multiple content domains with their own resolvers, and includes authentication via API keys, caching, search functionality, and user role management. You can explore it at [graphql.natwelch.com](https://graphql.natwelch.com/).

The code lives at [github.com/icco/graphql](https://github.com/icco/graphql). It's designed around the lessons learned from previous CMS attempts. The project serves as both my blog's backend and a central data store for other side projects that need structured content storage and retrieval.
