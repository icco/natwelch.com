## Nat Welch

Hi there! I am Nat. I was born in the San Francisco Bay Area, <Age />. I currently live in Beacon, NY with my wife Melissa and our cat Beasley. During the day I work as the Lead Cloud Platform Engineer for [Time by Ping](https://timebyping.com/).

You can see [my resume](https://resume.natwelch.com/) for my indepth
work history.

See my [Privacy Policy](https://natwelch.com/privacy) for what data I
keep when you visit this site and others I maintain.

See [Projects](https://natwelch.com/wiki/projects) for a list of my current
side projects.

I have some core beliefs that are the basis for most things that I do.

-   Sharing information is the most important action in human society.
-   I love automating things and building software tools to make
    maintaining the internet easier.
-   Nature is beautiful and must be preserved.
-   Humans are inherently good and hilarious, and communicating with
    them well is important.

I expand on these in depth on my blog: [Nat Welch Manifesto](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/703)

## Nat around the world

I have lived in San Francisco, London, New York and a few other places.
When I move, I try to create a blog post of my favorite places in a city
right before I leave. I then do not update them. As such, they are very
out of date. That being said, I enjoy looking at them and sharing with
friends traveling.
