title: Resume

You can see my full resume at [resume.natwelch.com](https://resume.natwelch.com), and another version on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natwelch/).

One weird thing is [my resume on Github](https://github.com/icco/resume) has a ton of stars and forks. This is because years ago, back in the early days of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), I submitted a blog post which talked about [maintaining your resume in Markdown](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/497). Hilariously, since then, I've rewritten my resume in plain HTML.
