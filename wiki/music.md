I make electronic music in my free time as a hobby. I've tried lots of different systems for making music (Ableton, Livecoding, Op-1, Volcas, etc) in the past, but currently my system of choice which is really resonating with me is a combination of [Monome Norns Shield](https://monome.org/docs/norns/shield/) and [Eurorack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurorack).

I put practice videos occasionally on [YouTube/@icco](https://www.youtube.com/@icco).

My eventual goal is to put together an album and release it as [Sub Alpine Drift](https://subalpinedrift.com/). I am not currently there, but that is my goal.
