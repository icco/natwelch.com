## What

I would like to be your colleague, friend and/or acquaintance. Why? Because, my career has been weird, and talking to others has helped me be somewhat successful in surviving some transitions. I have jumped to and from startups, big business, politics, writing, and many other situations. I failed out of college briefly, and have lived in ~five cities. If you think this experience would be useful to you, I would love to chat.

## How To

There are a few options to get in touch!

- You can book time to chat on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/icco/chat-with-nat).
- You can email me nat@natwelch.com.
