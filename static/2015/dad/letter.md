Dear Father,

Since you asked me to save my money, I decided to send you a postcard. I hope it made it to you alright.

Happy Birthday!

I've told you many times, but I'll tell you again, thanks for being awesome. You've been a constant inspiration to me, helping me move through life in a healthy and interesting way. As you complete another trip around the sun and prepare for your next, know that you have helped many people grow and be better individuals through your exemplary life and actions.

Travis, Mom and I are all super proud of you and honored to have you as a father.

Lots of Love,  
Nathaniel
