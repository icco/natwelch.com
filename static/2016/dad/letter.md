# Happy Father's Day!

Hey Dad,

This is a little webpage from your two sons. We both love you a lot. You know this, but we figured this was a good time to remind you.

We started by looking for a quote. Something that expressed the relationship you have with us. Your laughter, good nature, quiet contemplation and constant stream of advice. We found a nice quote by Umberto Eco. 

 > "I believe that what we become depends on what our fathers teach us at odd moments, when they aren't trying to teach us. We are formed by little scraps of wisdom."
 
 Mr. Eco was a semiotician and fiction writer [who died this year](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/20/arts/international/umberto-eco-italian-semiotician-and-best-selling-author-dies-at-84.html?_r=0). And we're not too surprised that someone who looked at symbols for a living is able to encapsulate the relationship between a father and his sons well.
 
 You've provided us both with a lot of wisdom. Whether it's how to tie a fishing knot, advice on dealing with people or just general affirmations that everything is going to be alright. We truly appreciate it. We wouldn't be the adults we are today without you.
 
Speaking of which, we are both impressed by all you have done in your life. Your success, perseverance, calm and professionalism in the workplace is inspiring. Now that you're retired, we're excited to see our wonderful parents relaxing. It's funny though, you're ability to shut off when you were not at work was always impressive, so seeing you relaxed now isn't surprising or unusual. You've always had that calm demeanor.

So thanks for everything! Happy Father's day! Know that you have two sons that love and miss you very much.

Lots of love,
Nathaniel & Travis
