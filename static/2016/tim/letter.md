Dear timball,

It was a pleasure working with you this past year. As much crap as I gave you throughout the year, I'm still honored that you hired me. You were the main person who hired me, and I still very much remember you sitting me down and asking me to install Scout. It was fun, and was probably one of my all time favorite interviews.

Once I started, I learned so much from you, dealing with everything we did. Your thoroughness inregards to incident response and attacks, despite everything you had to deal with was amazing.

Thanks to you, I feel like a far better engineer, and a much more paranoid person, and I am very greatful of that fact. If you ever need anything, hit me up, I'm your man.

Cheers,
/Nat
