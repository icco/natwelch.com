        <p>Dear Mark &amp; Tracy,</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>First things first: Happy Belated Birthday to each of you.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Second things second: Congratulations!</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>I&#39;ve always been incredibly oblivious, so for a while, I didn&#39;t really understand what was going on between you two. Tracy would come over, Mark would cook something, open a bottle of wine, and then you&#39;d play through some game that you both seemed to enjoy. And that kept going for a while.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Then there was this insane amount of time where you two were dating long distance, which I also didn&#39;t understand.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>But at some moment, I think it was over sushi in Seattle, the two of you were chatting about all of the things that you both loved (computers, salmon, etc), I realized that you were perfect for each other. You both have strong feelings about the things you love and enjoy. Your strong personalities sometimes clash, but it is so evident that you push each other forward, support each other and love each other. You are both obviously each others best friends, and as Nietzsche said "It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages."</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>I wish you both the best. I am honored to have you as friends.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>As Patrick Rothfuss put it, &quot;May all your stories be glad ones, and your roads be smooth and short.&quot;</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Lots of Love,<br />
        Nathaniel Welch</p>
