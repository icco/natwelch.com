    <p>Dear timball,</p>

    <p>It was a pleasure working with you this past year. As much crap as I gave you throughout the year, I am still honored that you hired me. You were the main person who hired me, and I still very much remember you sitting me down and asking me to install Scout. It was fun, and was probably one of my all time favorite interviews.</p>

    <p>Once I started, I learned so much from you, dealing with everything we did. Your thoroughness in regards to incident response and attacks, despite everything you had to deal with was amazing.</p>

    <p>Thanks to you, I feel like a far better engineer, and a much more paranoid person, and I am very grateful of that fact. If you ever need anything, hit me up, I am your man.</p>

    <p>Cheers,<br />
    /Nat</p>
