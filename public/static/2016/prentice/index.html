      <p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure center">Dear Prentice and Janet,</p>

      <p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure center">I am so happy for you.</p>

      <p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure center">Janet, I don&#8217;t know you well, but I have known Prentice for a few years, and I know that your love for each other will carry you far.</p>

      <p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure center">Prentice, I am sorry I am missing out on such an important day. I seem to have a habit of bailing out on your fantastic adventures. That being said, I wanted to dig up some sort of quote or advice for this special day. I feel like it is only appropriate. What good friend doesn&#8217;t spout nonsense at you whenever they can?</p>

      <p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure center">I am not married. The longest relationship I have ever been in lasted almost exactly a year. When you think of stability, you don&#8217;t think of me. That being said, I watch a lot of movies. I think I have some insight into the human condition based off of watching other people&#8217;s interpretations on the silver screen. And if not movies, then books. I&#8217;ve read a few books, and one or two have described a love as deep as one the two of you share.</p>

      <p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure center">So I tried to find a quote that might describe love, or provide you advice for your journey together, or maybe just put a smile on your face. </p>

      <p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure center">I stared at the internet for days. I could find nothing that expressed my feelings of love and joy for the joining of your union.</p>

      <p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure center">And then it hit me, a small quote from Patrick Rothfuss&#8217;s &#8220;Name of the Wind&#8221;.</p>

      <blockquote class="ph0 f4 f1-ns measure-narrow center">
        <p class="fw9 lh-copy lh-title-ns">May all your stories be glad ones, and your roads be smooth and short.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure center">That&#8217;s what I wish for you. Happiness! I love you both, and I wish you all the best.</p>

      <p class="f6 f4-ns lh-copy measure center">
      Your truly,
