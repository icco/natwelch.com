      <h1 class="f2 f-subheadline-ns mb4">Hello Mel.</h1>

      <p class="gray f5 mb4 ttu tracked">My love,</p>

      <p class="f4 f3-ns measure lh-copy">I was drinking coffee this morning, and a thought hit me. It hit me like a duck in the face. At first glance, it seemed simple: I really enjoy spending time with you. Your smile brightens my day; your laughter warms my heart; your words make me think.</p>

      <p class="f4 f3-ns measure lh-copy">So I thought, how do I express this to you, to thank you for, as you so eloquently put it, &#8220;spending time with me&#8221;. Do I go find you a card? No, I&#8217;ve never been good at picking cards. Do I buy you a gift? No, any gift will feel hasty and out of place. Shall I build you a website? Yes! That&#8217;s something I know how to do, and is personal, and will last, and yet not feel like too much.</p>

      <p class="f4 f3-ns measure lh-copy">So I sat down, and started thinking, what do I want on this website. Maybe a letter? Some photos? Music? Soon, I glanced at the clock, and an hour had passed. Words I decided. Words I am decent at. So I started digging through my favorite quotes, and of course the first one that comes up is from Mark Twain.</p>

      <blockquote class="bl pl4 ml0 f4 f3-ns measure lh-copy">
        <p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.&#8221;</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="f4 f3-ns measure lh-copy">Well put Mr. Twain. Here I am, already over-explaining things, which I&#8217;m still not sure if you hate or mildly dislike or find endearing. Two hundred words in, and still haven&#8217;t figured out the best way to say what I want. I think I will lean heavily on quotes, because maybe someone famous can express which my brain cannot.</p>

      <blockquote class="bl pl4 ml0 f4 f3-ns measure lh-copy">
        <p>&#8220;Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own.&#8221;
        &#8211; Robert A. Heinlein</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="f4 f3-ns measure lh-copy">Close, and very true. I love it when you are happy, it makes me happy. It brings me peace which I&#8217;ve rarely known.</p>

      <blockquote class="bl pl4 ml0 f4 f3-ns measure lh-copy">
        <p>&#8220;Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,
        And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.&#8221;
        &#8211; William Shakespeare</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="f4 f3-ns measure lh-copy">So true Mr. Shakespeare. Hmm, but all of this seems so cheesy. Maybe I can find a quote by one of the people inspire you to express how I feel.</p>

      <blockquote class="bl pl4 ml0 f4 f3-ns measure lh-copy">
        <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not exploring. I&#8217;m in.&#8221;
        &#8211; Joe Biden</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="f4 f3-ns measure lh-copy">A bit out of context, but perfect. I&#8217;m a wanderer at heart. I love walking with no destination, with no goal other than to see what&#8217;s next. But with you, I feel committed. I am all in, because I love you. I want to be by your side. I want to see you take on the world. I want to complement you. To be your arm candy, your devil&#8217;s advocate, your aperitif.</p>

      <p class="f4 f3-ns measure lh-copy">So thank you for all that you have given me. I hope I can give back in equal ways when you need me to.</p>

      <p>Lots of love,</p>
