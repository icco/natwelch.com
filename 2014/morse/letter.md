Dear Reed and Sara,

E.L. Doctorow once said that "Writing is like driving at night in the fog. You can only see as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way." As such, please bear with me as I ramble through this letter.

Hofstadter's Law says that "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law." In my mind, this quote could easily be applied to Sara's time in Davis, many of Reed's side projects, the time Reed spent in Sunnyvale, the drive to the Playa or any other timed event. But I don't want to lecture you on the struggles of your past, but rather a recently started endeavor. Two people, who I think are incredibly well matched, intelligent, creative and beautiful, are joining into what will be a very long and happy endeavor, and hopefully lasts far longer than anyone predicts.

Somewhat related, Daniel Burnham has this quote I have always loved: "Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood and probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will not die, but long after we are gone be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistence. Remember that our sons and our grandsons are going to do things that would stagger us. Let your watchword be order and your beacon beauty." There are people who might need a quote like this to inspire them. To motivate their hearts and push them forward. Neither of you, as far as I can tell, have ever had that problem. Your work ethic, determination and bright minds have been a lighthouse to us all, and working together, I can only see that light growing brighter. On top of that, starting a family is probably the big plan he was talking about in this quote.

Anyways, let me end on a variation of The Serenity Prayer, because I was always raised that important things need a good prayer to go with them.

 > Grant us the strength to accept the things that we cannot change, the courage to change the things we can and the wisdom to know the difference.

Congratulations and lots of love. I wish you both the best.

Your friend,  
Nathaniel Welch
