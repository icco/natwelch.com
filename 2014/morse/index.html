      <p>Dear Reed and Sara,</p>

      <p>E.L. Doctorow once said that &quot;Writing is like driving at night in the fog. You can only see as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.&quot; As such, please bear with me as I ramble through this letter.</p>

      <p>Hofstadter&#39;s Law says that &quot;It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter&#39;s Law.&quot; In my mind, this quote could easily be applied to Sara&#39;s time in Davis, many of Reed&#39;s side projects, the time Reed spent in Sunnyvale, the drive to the Playa or any other timed event. But I don&#39;t want to lecture you on the struggles of your past, but rather a recently started endeavor. Two people, who I think are incredibly well matched, intelligent, creative and beautiful, are joining into what will be a very long and happy endeavor, and hopefully lasts far longer than anyone predicts.</p>

      <p>Somewhat related, Daniel Burnham has this quote I have always loved: &quot;Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men&#39;s blood and probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will not die, but long after we are gone be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistence. Remember that our sons and our grandsons are going to do things that would stagger us. Let your watchword be order and your beacon beauty.&quot; There are people who might need a quote like this to inspire them. To motivate their hearts and push them forward. Neither of you, as far as I can tell, have ever had that problem. Your work ethic, determination and bright minds have been a lighthouse to us all, and working together, I can only see that light growing brighter. On top of that, starting a family is probably the big plan he was talking about in this quote.</p>

      <p>Anyways, let me end on a variation of The Serenity Prayer, because I was always raised that important things need a good prayer to go with them.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Grant us the strength to accept the things that we cannot change, the courage to change the things we can and the wisdom to know the difference.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Congratulations and lots of love. I wish you both the best.</p>

      <p>Your friend,<br>
      Nathaniel Welch</p>
