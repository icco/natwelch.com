# Happy Birthday Jeanne!

Hello my dear,

It's your old roomie Nathaniel Welch. I miss you and our various talks. I appreciate that you've kept in touch with wonderful postcards and quick messages here and there. You're a true friend.

So this year, on the culmination of your thirty first trip around the sun, I wanted to write you a letter.
