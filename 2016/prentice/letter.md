# Congratulations!

Dear Prentice and Janet,

I am so happy for you. Janet, I don't know you well, but I've known Prentice for a few years, and I know that your love for each other will carry you far.

Prentice, I am sorry I am missing out on such an important day. I seem to have a habit of bailing out on your fantastic adventures. That being said, I wanted to dig up some sort of quote or advice for this special day.

I am not married. The longest relationship I've ever been in lasted almost exactly a year. When you think of stability, you don't think of me. That being said, I watch a lot of movies. I think I have some insight into the human condition based off of watching other people's interpretations on the silver screen.

"I no longer believed in the idea of soul mates, or love at first sight. But I was beginning to believe that a very few times in your life, if you were lucky, you might meet someone who was exactly right for you. Not because he was perfect, or because you were, but because your combined flaws were arranged in a way that allowed two separate beings to hinge together."
â€• Lisa Kleypas
