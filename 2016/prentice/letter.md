# Congratulations!

Dear Prentice and Janet,

I am so happy for you.

Janet, I don't know you well, but I've known Prentice for a few years, and I know that your love for each other will carry you far.

Prentice, I am sorry I am missing out on such an important day. I seem to have a habit of bailing out on your fantastic adventures. That being said, I wanted to dig up some sort of quote or advice for this special day. I feel like it's only appropriate. What good friend doesn't spout nonsense at you whenever they can?

I am not married. The longest relationship I've ever been in lasted almost exactly a year. When you think of stability, you don't think of me. That being said, I watch a lot of movies. I think I have some insight into the human condition based off of watching other people's interpretations on the silver screen. And if not movies, then books. I've read a few books, and one or two have described a love as deep as one the two of you share.

So I tried to find a quote that might describe love, or provide you advice for your journey together, or maybe just put a smile on your face. 

I stared at the internet for days. I could find nothing that expressed my feelings of love and joy for the joining of your union.

And then it hit me, a small quote from Patrick Rothfuss's "Name of the Wind".

 > May all your stories be glad ones, and your roads be smooth and short.

That's what I wish for you. Happiness! I love you both, and I wish you all the best.

Your truly,

Nathaniel Welch
