      <p>Dear Michael,</p>

      <p>You probably realize this, but I really enjoyed working with you this past year. Your constant dedication to the job, and general belief in the system is inspiring.</p>

      <p>Your ability to stay on top of things in an organized manner has never been my strong suite, and watching you chase down stakeholders and tickets was inspiring. That sounds kind of absurd, but I mean it. I can not tell you the number of times in past jobs where I have found tickets from six months ago that needed to get done, and not only had I let it slide, but it caused more work for me later on because I forgot. With you that never or rarely happened, and it made our team stronger and well respected. Without that respect we would have been lost.</p>

      <p>I love your general demeanor. You were always willing to talk about things honestly and openly and I very much viewed you as a friend. Tech-Ops would have faltered on so many occasions if we as a team didn&#8217;t stay friends, so thank you.</p>

      <p>I wish you the best in the future. I hope you stay in touch, and if you ever need anything, please do not hesitate to reach out. It has been an honor.</p>

      <p>Cheers,<br/>
      /Nat</p>
