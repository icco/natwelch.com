# Hello Mel.

My love,

I was drinking coffee this morning, and a thought hit me. It hit me like a duck in the face. At first glance, it seemed simple: I really enjoy spending time with you. Your smile brightens my day; your laughter warms my heart; your words make me think.

So I thought, how do I express this to you, to thank you for, as you so eloquently put it, "spending time with me". Do I go find you a card? No, I've never been good at picking cards. Do I buy you a gift? No, any gift will feel hasty and out of place. Shall I build you a website? Yes! That's something I know how to do, and is personal, and will last, and yet not feel like too much.

So I sat down, and started thinking, what do I want on this website. Maybe a letter? Some photos? Music? Soon, I glanced at the clock, and an hour had passed. Words I decided. Words I am decent at. So I started digging through my favorite quotes, and of course the first one that comes up is from Mark Twain.

> "I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead."
 
Well put Mr. Twain. Here I am, already over-explaining things, which I'm still not sure if you hate or mildly dislike or find endearing. Two hundred words in, and still haven't figured out the best way to say what I want. I think I will lean heavily on quotes, because maybe someone famous can express which my brain cannot.

> "Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own."
> -- Robert A. Heinlein

Close, and very true. I love it when you are happy, it makes me happy. It brings me peace which I've rarely known.

> "Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,
> And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind."
> -- William Shakespeare

So true Mr. Shakespeare. Hmm, but all of this seems so cheesy. Maybe I can find a quote by one of the people inspire you to express how I feel.

> "I'm not exploring. I’m in."
> -- Joe Biden

A bit out of context, but perfect. I'm a wanderer at heart. I love walking with no destination, with no goal other than to see what's next. But with you, I feel committed. I am all in, because I love you. I want to be by your side. I want to see you take on the world. I want to complement you. To be your arm candy, your devil's advocate, your apéritif. 

So thank you for all that you have given me. I hope I can give back in equal ways when you need me to.

Lots of love,
